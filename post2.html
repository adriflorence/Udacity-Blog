                    The Ningaloo Reef is home to a myriad of marine life. Every spring one of the rarest and largest fish in the world migrates here ­– <strong>the whale shark</strong>. These sea Goliaths, of up to 12m in length, are regular visitors to the reef from March to June.
                    The coral spawning at this time of year create plankton-rich waters to draw the whale sharks close to the reef in search of food. The 18-tonne giants swim along with their colossal mouths open wide, near to the surface to scoop the tiny plants and animals up.
                    Each whale shark has a unique, distinctive pattern of light, pigmented spots along their forward flanks. These markings have proved to be effective in differentiating individual sharks. The fascinating creatures can dive to depths over 1,000m in search of food and will soon make their escape to the deep if disturbed.
