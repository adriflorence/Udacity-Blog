                    <h3>Simonstown, South Africa</h3>
                    <p>Windmill Beach in Simonstown, South Africa, is the location for an amazing, alternative dive. Forget coral reefs and imagine a flooded kelp forest. Shore dive into towering plants and swim with excitable cape fur seals. The stars of the show come out to play, twirl in and out of the kelp and vie for your attention. Their inquisitive behaviour makes this dive particularly special. They aren’t shy of human visitors and will happily swim parallel to your dive course as you make your way around the rocky point. The mischievous mammals only fear one ocean inhabitant, their main predator ­– <strong>the great white shark.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Ningaloo Reef, Australia</h3>
                    <p>The Ningaloo Reef is home to a myriad of marine life. Every spring one of the rarest and largest fish in the world migrates here ­– <strong>the whale shark</strong>. These sea Goliaths, of up to 12m in length, are regular visitors to the reef from March to June.
                        The coral spawning at this time of year create plankton-rich waters to draw the whale sharks close to the reef in search of food. The 18-tonne giants swim along with their colossal mouths open wide, near to the surface to scoop the tiny plants and animals up.
                        Each whale shark has a unique, distinctive pattern of light, pigmented spots along their forward flanks. These markings have proved to be effective in differentiating individual sharks. The fascinating creatures can dive to depths over 1,000m in search of food and will soon make their escape to the deep if disturbed.

                    <h3>East Antarctic Peninsula, Antarctica</h3>
                    <p>Diving in Antarctica is certainly not for the faint-hearted but if you want to dive in a unique location that has been explored by a brave few then this might just be the experience you’ve been looking for! However, there is a catch, due the extreme diving conditions you must be an experienced diver that has at least a recommended 20 dry suit dives under your belt. You must also have experience of cold water diving – this will allow you to dive off the edges of ice floes and around monumental icebergs.</p>
